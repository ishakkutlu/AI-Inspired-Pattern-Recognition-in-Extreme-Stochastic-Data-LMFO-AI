### **Update Dated August 26, 2024**
- In the rar file named "Layered_Multiple_Frequency_Optimization", you will find the dataset for the Keno game, known as On Numara in Türkiye. In this Keno game, 22 out of 80 numbers are drawn, and the goal is to make correct predictions, such as 10 out of 10 or 9 out of 10, always using 10 numbers. The draws take place twice a week. This version of the LMFO AI will only work seamlessly when 22 numbers are drawn from a set of 80.
- In the rar file named "Layered_Multiple_Frequency_Optimization_Lucky_Day", you will find the dataset for the Keno game known as Lucky Day in the Netherlands. In this Keno version, 20 out of 80 numbers are drawn, and the objective is to make correct predictions such as 10 out of 10, 9 out of 10, or 9 out of 9, 8 out of 9, etc., using varying amounts of numbers (e.g., 10, 9, 8, etc.). The draws are held daily. This version of the LMFO AI will work seamlessly with different draw scenarios, such as 22, 21, 20, 19, etc., out of 80 numbers.
- The update has been made on the VBA side to ensure the algorithm can be validated on different Keno datasets; no updates have been made to the Python side.
