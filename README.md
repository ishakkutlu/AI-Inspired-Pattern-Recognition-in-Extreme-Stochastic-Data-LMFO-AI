Layered Multiple Frequency Optimization (LMFO) / Experimental Study on Forecasting the Lottery Game Called "Keno" or "Number 10" as an Example of Large-Scale Problem

This algorithm, called Layered Multiple Frequency Optimization (LMFO), is a product of individual curiosity and was initially developed using fields such as mathematics, statistics, and computer science, which are closely related to artificial intelligence technologies. The design of the algorithm is based on metaheuristic optimization techniques, which have the potential to produce solutions to complex and large-scale problems. The algorithm features a three-layer architecture and consists of four Python files and one Excel file that exchange data with each other using Python and VBA programming languages.

The algorithm is an experimental application that aims to search for patterns and make forecasts using data science techniques in large-scale problems with increasing complexity in a combinatorial manner. The lottery is thought to be one of the best examples representing combinatorial problem structure and complexity. In this context, the algorithm is specifically designed to investigate patterns in a lottery game called “Number 10.” The game "Number 10" was chosen for the experimental study because its mathematical probability is approximately 1 in 2.5 million [C(22;10)/C(80;10) = 3.9274*10^(-7)]. The probability of finding a solution is relatively higher compared to other lottery games, thus providing motivation for the experimental study.

I would like to express my endless gratitude to my precious wife, Zeliha, and my daughter, Elif Mira, who never spared their support and understanding during the development process of this study.
